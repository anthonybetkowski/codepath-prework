**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Anthony Betkowski**

Time spent: **6** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/entertaining-just-confidence?path=index.html%3A1%3A0)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Play around with the aesthetics of the game and make it look higher quality. Maybe add something to the background and change the text font and size to make it look unique.
    
[ ] Add a screen to the game when you lose. Something like "Game Over" or "You Lose" along with a sound effect of some sort. Then the player has the option to restart.

[ ] Add a stopwatch at the top left of the screen to see how long the user has been playing.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

The biggest challenge while completing this prework assignment is using the different applications such as GitHub, Glitch, Visual Studio Code, LiceApp, etc; and figuring out how these applications work. I have never heard of or used any of these applications before so it was difficult to learn how to use them at first. Completing an assignment that requires me to download 4 or more different applications is something I am new to, but I understand that I will use them sometime in the future. I overcame these challenges by being patient and using all the resources I have at my disposal to figure out how to use the applications.  

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

Will I create more projects like this or more complex ones with my time with CodePath?
Will I work in teams/partners to make these projects more easier and of better quality?
Why do projects like these require so many applications to be used? Are all projects similar to this one in terms of application use?
What are the most popular applications used in web development?


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

1.) First I would go back and check my code to make sure it is correct and organized for me and the person who is going to look at it.

2.) Add different modes such as a mode with no color and only sound and vice versa. A mode with a button more or less depending on what the player chooses. A two player mode where there are two screens and two people play to see who lasts the longest; there would be a counter on the top right of the screen to show who has how many wins.

3.) A counter on the screen that shows how many patterns the player got right in a row. Another counter that shows the player his/her record.

4.) A choice for the player the increase or decrease the difficulty. This would be done by increasing or decreasing the speed at which the game shows you the color and sound. The faster, the harder; and the slower, the easier.
